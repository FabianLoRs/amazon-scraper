# Amazon Product Scraper (Test Project)

This project demonstrates a simple web scraper that fetches product information (title, rating, review count, image URL) from the first page of Amazon search results for a given keyword.

**Disclaimer:** Scraping Amazon is against their Terms of Service. This project is for educational purposes only. Frequent use may result in IP bans. Amazon's website structure changes often, which *will* break the scraper's CSS selectors.
